Day 4: Data: My Data

Data Source:
Data: Gifts received from a Pokémon Go trainer (consent obtained)

Steps:
1. Load point dataset and basemap (e.g. Carto Dark Matter). Set symbology to Heatmap. The following colour gradient was used. The 0% mark needs to have 0% opacity so you will be able to see the basemap. 

Value (%)	Color		Hex Code	Opacity
0		Deep Blue	#0D1B2A		0%
15		Cyan Glow	#00FFFF		20%
40		Magenta Pop	#FF00FF		60%
70		Lava Orange	#FF6F00		80%
100		Neon Yellow	#FFFF00		100%

2. Set Blending Mode for Layer to Hard Light.

3. Consider experimentation with different colour schemes and basemaps.
