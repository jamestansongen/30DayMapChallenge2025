1. Vector>Research Tools>Create Grid (Grid type: Rectangle (Polygon), Grid extent: calculate from layer, Horizontal spacing: 3000m, Vertical Spacing: 3000m, Grid CRS: Layer CRS)
2. Search for Raster analysis. Set input to the Grid and Raster layer to your image. Select the first band and change the output column prefix (e.g. Band1) followed by Mean, Median and Majority for statistics to calculate. Repeat this process of the new grid with the next two bands.
3. Select by features with expression "band1mean" IS NOT NULL AND "band2mean" IS NOT NULL AND "band3mean" IS NOT NULL and export to get grid that have values.
4. For the fill of the grid, edit and set expression builder to color_rgb(scale_linear("band1mean",0,0.2,0,255), scale_linear("band2mean",0,0.2,0,255), scale_linear("band3mean",0,0.2,0,255)). Add drop shadow.
5. Vector>Geometry Tools>Centroids. tick create centroid for each part and save. Repeat the same symbology in Step 4 and adjust size accordingly (e.g. 1 to 1.5)
