Day 3: Polygon

Data Source:
1. Bathymetry survey of Crater Lake 2000: https://oe.oregonexplorer.info/craterlake/bathymetry.html
2. USGS 1/3 arc-second Digital Elevation Model https://portal.opentopography.org/raster?opentopoID=OTNED.012021.4269.1

Steps:
1. Georeference Bathymetry raster to DEM
2. Open Raster calculator and calculate depth by depth = 1882.6 - "elevation"
Note: "The bathymetry data was converted from water depths to elevations using a lake level of 1882.6 m above sea level at the time of the multibeam survey. This was done because the lake level fluctuates seasonally and annually." USGS
3. Use Contour Polygons to generate polygons for both DEM and bathymetry (interval = 50 or any other value)
4. Bathymetry contour polygon symbology-->Categorized-->ELEV_MIN-->Blues (Go to advanced and set symbol levels where shallower depths get higher symbol levels and vice versa (e.g. depth = 0, symbol level = 11; depth = 550, symbol level = 0). Add drop shadow for all values.
5. DEM contour polygon symbology-->Categorized-->ELEV_MIN-->Turbo (Go to advanced and set symbol levels where lower elevations get lower symbol levels and vice versa (e.g. elevation = 1550, symbol level = 12; elevation = 2700, symbol level = 35). Add drop shadow for all values.
6. Duplicate the DEM, set the Render type to Hillshade. Set Blending mode to multiply.

7. Export 2D map and legend to Canva/Illustrator for further designing
