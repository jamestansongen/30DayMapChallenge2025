### Day 1: Points

For Day 1’s theme on Points, I used a firefly symbology where each glowing dot marks one of the 214 Wainwrights: the iconic fells of the Lake District immortalized in Alfred Wainwright’s Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells (1955–1966). A constellation of summits, lighting up the landscape.
