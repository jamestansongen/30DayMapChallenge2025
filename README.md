## Introduction

### About me

I am currently a Principal Geomatics Engineer at the Singapore Land Authority and hold an MSc in Urban Spatial Science from the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London (UCL). \
I specialise in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote Sensing, Data Science, and Agent-Based Modelling, while my other interests include hiking, drone piloting/photography and board games. \
For opportunities or collaboration, I can be contacted via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-tan-song-en-76b73418a/)

### Day 2: Lines

What started as a simple plan to plot satellite orbits on a static map spiraled into an interactive 3D visualisation where you can toggle different satellites and rotate around the Earth to explore their paths. I reused the code to showcase the orbital paths of both NOAA’s polar-orbiting satellites and GOES geostationary satellites, highlighting the contrast in how they observe our planet.

### Day 1: Points

For Day 1’s theme on Points, I used a firefly symbology where each glowing dot marks one of the 214 Wainwrights: the iconic fells of the Lake District immortalized in Alfred Wainwright’s Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells (1955–1966). A constellation of summits, lighting up the landscape.
